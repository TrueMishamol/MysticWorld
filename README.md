# MysticWorld

Minecraft Datapack. Long enough unfinished project, but still pretty interesting one

It adds new tools, materials, bosses etc. In future I wish to even add some new blocks! But datapacks are very laggy, so I don't know is it worth it

Right now I'm working on refactoring. Next I plan to slowly recreate each item individually piece-by-piece, and achieve that each tool will be unique and "noteworthy"
